## Overview

This visualization demonstrates a fundamental concept in natural language processing: word embeddings are not arbitrary mappings but geometric spaces where semantic relationships are encoded as spatial relationships. When we say "king - man + woman = queen," this isn't metaphorical - it's literal vector arithmetic that works because gender relationships form parallel vectors in the embedding space.

### Why This Matters

1. **Semantic Search**: Understanding embedding geometry explains why similarity search works
2. **Transfer Learning**: Shows why pre-trained embeddings capture useful patterns
3. **Model Interpretability**: Reveals what neural networks learn about language
4. **Practical Applications**: From recommendation systems to language translation

## Core Concepts

### What Are Word Embeddings?

Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words, typically in 50-300 dimensions. Unlike one-hot encoding (where each word is a sparse vector with a single 1), embeddings place semantically similar words near each other in continuous space.

### Why Geometry Matters

The key insight is that **relationships between words become geometric relationships between vectors**:

- **Distance** = Semantic similarity (closer words are more related)
- **Direction** = Semantic relationship (the vector from "man" to "woman" encodes gender)
- **Linear combinations** = Conceptual combinations ("royal" + "woman" ≈ "queen")

### Embedding Methods Visualized

1. **Word2Vec (Skip-gram)**
   - Predicts context words from center word
   - Creates sharp linear relationships
   - Famous for analogies working via vector arithmetic

2. **GloVe (Global Vectors)**
   - Combines global co-occurrence statistics with local context
   - More stable, smoother geometry
   - Better captures word frequency effects

3. **Contextual (BERT-like)**
   - Same word gets different vectors in different contexts
   - "Bank" (financial) vs "Bank" (river) have different positions
   - Shows why context matters for meaning

4. **Custom Training Demo**
   - Watch embeddings form during training
   - See how random initialization becomes structured space
   - Understand how training objective shapes geometry

### 2. Vector Arithmetic Operations

The famous "King - Man + Woman = Queen" demonstration:

#### How It Works
1. Takes three input words (A, B, C)
2. Computes result vector: Vector(A) - Vector(B) + Vector(C)
3. Finds nearest word to resulting vector
4. Visualizes operation with colored arrows

#### Why It Works
- Relationships are encoded as vector differences
- "King" - "Man" extracts the "royalty" component
- Adding "Woman" combines femininity with royalty
- Result lands near "Queen"

### Key Components

#### 1. Three.js Scene Setup

```javascript
// Scene initialization
scene = new THREE.Scene();
scene.background = new THREE.Color(0xf5f5f5);

// Camera with perspective projection
camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, width/height, 0.1, 1000);
camera.position.set(3, 3, 3);

// WebGL renderer with antialiasing
renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
```

**Why These Settings**:
- 75° FOV: Natural perspective without distortion
- Position (3,3,3): Good initial overview angle
- Antialiasing: Smooth edges for better visuals
- Light background: High contrast with colored points

#### 2. Custom OrbitControls Implementation

The controls allow intuitive 3D navigation:
- **Spherical coordinates**: Natural rotation around target
- **Damping**: Smooth, non-jarring movement
- **Constraints**: Prevents flipping/disorientation
- **Auto-rotation**: Showcases 3D nature

#### 3. Embedding Data Structure

```javascript
embeddings = {
    'word': {
        category: 'person|place|concept|object|action',
        vec: [x, y, z]  // 3D coordinates (reduced from 300D)
    }
}
```

**Design Decisions**:
- Pre-reduced to 3D: Real embeddings are 50-300D
- Normalized vectors: Consistent scale
- Category labels: Enable semantic coloring
- JavaScript object: Fast lookup by word

#### 4. Dimensionality Reduction (Simulated)

Real embeddings are high-dimensional. The visualization simulates different algorithms' effects:

```javascript
embeddingTransforms = {
    word2vec: vec => vec + small_noise,
    glove: vec => vec * dimension_scaling + small_noise,
    contextual: vec => vec + large_noise
}
```

**Why Different Transforms**:
- Word2Vec: Small noise (stable training)
- GloVe: Dimension scaling (frequency effects)
- Contextual: Large noise (context variation)

#### 5. Vector Operations Implementation

```javascript
// Vector arithmetic
resultVec = vecA.map((v, i) => v - vecB[i] + vecC[i])

// Cosine similarity
similarity = dotProduct(vec1, vec2) / (magnitude(vec1) * magnitude(vec2))

// Nearest neighbor search
neighbors = vocabulary
    .map(word => ({word, sim: cosineSimilarity(target, word.vec)}))
    .sort((a, b) => b.sim - a.sim)
    .slice(0, k)
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Element-wise operations for arithmetic
- Normalized vectors simplify similarity
- Efficient sorting for nearest neighbors
- Excludes query words from results

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Frustum Culling**: Three.js automatically skips off-screen objects
2. **Level of Detail**: Labels only shown when enabled
3. **Efficient Updates**: Only recreate changed elements
4. **WebGL Acceleration**: GPU-powered rendering
5. **Lazy Connections**: Similarity lines computed on-demand

### Browser Compatibility

- **Required**: WebGL support (all modern browsers)
- **Optimal**: Chrome/Firefox/Safari latest versions
- **Mobile**: Touch controls not implemented
- **Performance**: Best with dedicated GPU

## Mathematical Foundation

### Vector Space Model

Words exist in an n-dimensional space where:
- Each dimension captures some semantic feature
- Linear combinations preserve meaning
- Geometric operations have semantic interpretations

### Key Equations

1. **Cosine Similarity**:
   ```
   similarity(u, v) = (u · v) / (||u|| × ||v||)
   ```
   Measures angle between vectors (ignore magnitude)

2. **Analogy Completion**:
   ```
   d = argmax_w similarity(w, b - a + c)
   ```
   Find word w closest to the analogy result

3. **Clustering Coefficient**:
   ```
   C = Σ (n_i(n_i-1)) / Σ k_i(k_i-1)
   ```
   Measures how clustered the embedding space is

### Why Linear Relationships Work

The skip-gram objective (Word2Vec) optimizes:
```
max Σ log P(context|word)
```

This creates linear relationships because:
1. Log probabilities become additive
2. Similar contexts → similar vectors
3. Relationships encoded as vector offsets

## Educational Value

### Core Learning Outcomes

1. **Embeddings Are Not Random**
   - Structured space emerges from training
   - Semantic relationships become geometric
   - Distance and direction have meaning

2. **Different Algorithms, Different Geometries**
   - Training objective shapes the space
   - Word2Vec: Predictive → sharp clusters
   - GloVe: Count-based → smooth distribution

3. **Analogies Are Vector Arithmetic**
   - Not metaphorical but mathematical
   - Linear relationships enable reasoning
   - Limitations show where linearity breaks

4. **Context Matters**
   - Static embeddings: One vector per word
   - Contextual embeddings: Meaning varies
   - Trade-offs in representation

### Classroom Activities

1. **Exploration Exercise**
   - Find three working analogies
   - Find one that fails and explain why
   - Compare results across methods

2. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Predict which words cluster together
   - Test predictions with search
   - Explain surprising results

3. **Relationship Discovery**
   - Find parallel relationships (like gender)
   - Test if they work across categories
   - Discuss cultural biases in embeddings

## Common Misconceptions Addressed

### 1. "Embeddings are just lookup tables"

**Reality**: They encode rich geometric structure
- **Evidence**: Vector arithmetic works
- **Demonstration**: King - Man + Woman = Queen
- **Implication**: Relationships are learnable patterns

### 2. "All embedding methods are similar"

**Reality**: Different training creates different geometries
- **Evidence**: Switch between methods in visualization
- **Observation**: Word positions change significantly
- **Implication**: Method choice matters for applications

### 3. "Higher dimensions are just more features"

**Reality**: Geometry in high dimensions is counterintuitive
- **Evidence**: All vectors become nearly orthogonal
- **Demonstration**: Average similarity decreases with dimensions
- **Implication**: Curse of dimensionality is real

### 4. "Embeddings are objective representations"

**Reality**: They encode training data biases
- **Evidence**: Gender stereotypes in analogies
- **Example**: Doctor - Man + Woman ≠ Doctor
- **Implication**: Critical evaluation needed

### 5. "Context doesn't matter for word meaning"

**Reality**: Same word, different contexts, different meanings
- **Evidence**: Contextual vs static embeddings
- **Example**: "Bank" (financial) vs "Bank" (river)
- **Implication**: Static embeddings have limitations

## Extending the Visualization
